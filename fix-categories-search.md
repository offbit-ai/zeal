# Fixed Categories and Search Issues

## Problem
1. Categories were not loading on the sidebar
2. Search functionality was not working

## Root Cause
The nodeRepositoryStore was updated to use new `/api/templates` endpoints that were not fully implemented with database queries. The `/api/templates/categories` endpoint was returning data from a service method instead of directly querying the database.

## Solution
Reverted to use the existing, working endpoints:
- Changed from `/api/templates/categories` back to `/api/nodes/categories`
- Changed from `/api/templates` back to `/api/nodes`
- Updated search parameter from `q` to `search` to match the `/api/nodes` endpoint
- Disabled autocomplete since `/api/nodes` doesn't have an autocomplete endpoint

## Changes Made

### 1. nodeRepositoryStore.ts
- Reverted endpoints:
  - Categories: `/api/templates/categories` → `/api/nodes/categories`
  - Templates: `/api/templates` → `/api/nodes`
- Fixed search parameter: `q` → `search`
- Disabled autocomplete functionality (not available in `/api/nodes`)
- Removed debug logging

### 2. WorkflowSidebar.tsx
- Removed debug logging
- Component now properly fetches and displays categories

## How It Works Now
1. **Categories Loading**: Uses `/api/nodes/categories` which queries from database
2. **Search**: Uses `/api/nodes?search=...` which supports semantic search through nodeTemplateService
3. **Both endpoints are already properly implemented and working**

## Testing
1. Open workflow editor - sidebar should show categories
2. Use search modal - search should return results from database
3. Filter by category - should properly filter results
